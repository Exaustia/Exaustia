### ![Hi](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/958073331536506951.png "Hi")

🔭 I'm working for Aiternate Studios since september 2021. 

🌱 I'm focused on the front-end, with ReactJS. I also do some Backend on NodeJS.

🤗 I'm always learning new technologies (especially Web3-related) 

🤫 I've created a lots of websites (~30+)
- [Aiternate](https://www.aiternate.com/)
- [Aiternate App](https://app.aiternate.com/)
- [Neotoys](https://neotoys.net/)

👯 I love learn new things, so, if you have something to show me, don't hesitate!

💻 AWS Dev0ps when I have some time or when I need to host websites, create new API with Lambda/ECS and add some CI / CD 🖋️
